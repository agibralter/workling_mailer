WorklingMailer
==============

This plugin provides a module which - when included into an ActionMailer subclass - pushes all emails that would normally be delivered synchronously into a queue for asynchronous processing. For queuing it relies on the workling plugin (http://github.com/purzelrakete/workling) which can use for example twitter's starling as a queue server.

How it works
============

The plugin provides a module AsynchMail. To make a mailer use a queue simply include it into the class like this:

class MyMailer < ActionMailer::Base
	include AsynchMail
end

From now on all MyMailer.deliver_whatever_email calls create an entry in the MailerWorker.deliver_mail corresponding queue and should be processed by a worker. If you still want to deliver mail sycnhronously add a bang to the method call: MyMailer.deliver_whatever_email!

Installation
============

If you are on rails edge (which supports git) you can simply do a 
script/plugin install git://github.com/langalex/workling_mailer.git

If not you need to do this from your rails root:

cd vendor/plugins
git clone git://github.com/langalex/workling_mailer.git --depth 1
cd ../../..

Credits

Parts of the code (the method_missing implementation) were taken from the mail_queue plugin (http://code.google.com/p/mail-queue/) which queues emails in a database table.
